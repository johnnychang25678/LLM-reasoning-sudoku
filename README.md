### Plan for Building a Sudoku Solver Using MCTS-Augmented LLM

This document outlines the plan to develop a Sudoku solver that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a Large Language Model (LLM) for reasoning, inspired by the AlphaMath framework. The goal is to leverage the LLM's reasoning capabilities for policy generation and enhance its decision-making process through a trained value model.

#### 1. System Architecture

The system will comprise two main components:
1. **Policy Model (LLM):** Used to generate potential actions at each step of solving a Sudoku puzzle.
2. **Value Model:** Formed by augmenting the LLM with an additional linear layer to predict the Q-values of states during the MCTS process.

These components will work iteratively within the MCTS framework to generate reasoning paths, evaluate intermediate states, and progressively improve solution quality.

#### 2. Implementation Steps

##### 2.1 Initial Setup
- **Deployment:** Deploy a pre-trained LLM (e.g., Llama) on a cloud-based machine to act as the policy model.
- **Value Model Initialization:** Add a linear layer to the LLM's final layer to form the value model. Initialize the parameters of the linear layer randomly.
- **Environment Preparation:** Define the Sudoku-solving environment, including:
  - State representation: Partial Sudoku solutions.
  - Actions: Filling in a cell with a valid number.
  - Terminal state: A fully solved Sudoku puzzle.

##### 2.2 Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
- **Tree Initialization:** Begin with the initial state representing the unsolved Sudoku puzzle as the root node.
- **Node Selection:** Use a variant of the PUCT algorithm to traverse the tree and select nodes with high exploration-exploitation potential:
  \[
  a_t = \arg\max_{a \in \text{Actions}(s_t)} \left[ Q(s_t, a) + c_{\text{puct}} \cdot \pi_\theta(a|s_t) \sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{parent}}}{1 + N(s_t, a)}} \right]
  \]
- **Action Expansion:** Expand new nodes based on the policy model’s predictions.
- **State Evaluation:**
  - For terminal nodes, calculate the reward (e.g., +1 for correct solutions, -1 for incorrect solutions).
  - For non-terminal nodes, evaluate the state using a weighted combination of the value model's prediction and the rollout reward:
  \[
  \hat{V}(s_t) = (1 - \lambda) \cdot V_\phi(s_t) + \lambda \cdot \text{rollout reward}
  \]
- **Backpropagation:** Update the Q-values and visit counts of nodes along the path from the selected leaf node back to the root.

##### 2.3 Training the Value Model
- **Data Collection:** Generate training data by storing the Q-values and corresponding states from the MCTS tree.
- **Training Objective:** Optimize the value model to minimize the regression loss between the predicted and actual Q-values:
  \[
  \mathcal{L}_{V_\phi}(s) = \| V_\phi(s) - \tilde{V}(s) \|^2
  \]
- **Training Process:** Train the value model for multiple epochs using the reasoning steps (states) and Q-values obtained from the MCTS process.

##### 2.4 Iterative Refinement
- **Tree Expansion:** Grow the MCTS tree further using the updated value model to improve the quality of generated reasoning paths.
- **Policy Model Improvement:** Optionally fine-tune the LLM using reasoning steps generated during the MCTS process.
- **Repeat:** Continue iterating between MCTS and value model training until performance stabilizes or predefined criteria are met.

##### 2.5 Final Inference
- **Unseen Puzzle Solving:**
  - Input: A previously unseen Sudoku puzzle.
  - Use the trained value model to guide the policy model through MCTS, enabling efficient exploration and exploitation of solution paths.
- **Output:** A solved Sudoku puzzle, verified by the system’s internal rules.

#### 3. Expected Outcomes
By integrating MCTS with an LLM and iteratively training the value model, this system is expected to:
- Solve Sudoku puzzles effectively without relying on labeled process supervision.
- Demonstrate improved reasoning capabilities over time through iterative self-improvement.
- Provide a scalable framework adaptable to other logical reasoning tasks.
